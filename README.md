# Spiking Neural Network

This is a simple python implementation of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN).

## Neuron Models
It includes two neuron models, the simplified Leaky Integrate and Fire model and the biophysically inspired Hodgkin-Huxley model.

## Learning Methods
It includes two learning methods, Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
