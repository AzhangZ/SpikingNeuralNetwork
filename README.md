# Spiking Neural Network

This is a simple python implementation of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) using spiking neuron models, with some Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity based learning methods.

## Neuron Models
It includes two neuron models, the simplified Leaky Integrate and Fire model and the biophysically inspired Hodgkin-Huxley model.

**Note -** Only the Integrate and Fire neuron model is implemented fully.

## Learning Methods
It includes three learning methods:
- Basic Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
- Homeostatic STDP variant
- Hedonistic reward-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) STDP variant

## Tools

### Visualisation Tool
This repository also includes a simple visualisation tool that is intended to allow viewing of the network structure and firing over time.
